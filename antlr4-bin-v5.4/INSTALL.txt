As a first step you should download all necessary files (latest versions of: antlr-4.7.*complete.jar, antlr4-bin*zip,
and antlr4-4.7.*-javadoc.zip) to current directory (for example, to Desktop).

(Note the bash executable code is marked with <bash> ... </bash> blocks.
Naturally only the commands inside such blocks are executable.)


=== Section 1: ANTLR4 installation ===

STEP 1: Install ANTLR4

Latest version of antlr-4.7.*-complete.jar required.

Check java version with command:

<bash>
java -version
</bash>

(Number: 1.8* means that it is version 8 of java)


a) Install ANTLR4 - Alternative 1 (preferable, but only works with java versions <= 8):
(assumes that antlr4's complete jar file is in current directory)

- as root (sudo) create directory /usr/java/packages/lib/ext

<bash>
sudo mkdir --parents /usr/java/packages/lib/ext
</bash>

- cp jar file (oracle java):

<bash>
file=$(ls -f antlr-4.7.*-complete.jar | sort | tail -1)
sudo cp ${file} /usr/java/packages/lib/ext/
</bash>

- cp jar file (OpenJDK java):

<bash>
file=$(ls -f antlr-4.7.*-complete.jar | sort | tail -1)
sudo cp ${file} /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-*/jre/lib/ext/
</bash>


b) Install ANTLR4 - Alternative 2 (works with all java versions):

- copy antlr-4.7.*-complete.jar to directory: /usr/local/lib/

<bash>
file=$(ls -f antlr-4.7.*-complete.jar | sort | tail -1)
sudo cp ${file} /usr/local/lib/
</bash>

- change ~/.bashrc (or /etc/bash.bashrc, or /etc/bashrc) to define CLASSPATH and ANTLR4_PATH variables:

<bash>
file=$(ls -f antlr-4.7.*-complete.jar | sort | tail -1)
echo "export CLASSPATH=\".:/usr/local/lib/${file}:$CLASSPATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ANTLR4_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib\"" >> ~/.bashrc
</bash>

(Alternative 2 assumes bash shell. For other shells see its documentation.)


STEP 2: Copy scripts to directory: /usr/local/bin/
(assumes that antlr4's bin zip file is in current directory)

<bash>
file=$(ls -f antlr4-bin-v*.zip | sort | tail -1)
unzip ${file}
sudo mv bin/* /usr/local/bin/
rmdir bin
</bash>

NOTE: gawk and cpp programs are required for antlr4-test script (install them if missing)
<bash>
sudo apt install gawk
</bash>



=== Section 2: ANTLR4 and java documentation ===


STEP 1: Install ANTLR4 documentation
(assumes that antlr4's javadoc zip file is in current directory)

<bash>
file=$(ls -f antlr4-4.7.*-javadoc.zip | sort | tail -1)
sudo mkdir --parents /usr/local/doc/javadoc
(p=$(pwd); cd /usr/local/doc/javadoc; sudo unzip ${p}/${file})
</bash>


STEP 2: Install Java documentation

Try:

<bash>
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-doc
</bash>
(if necessary/desired, replace 8 with a newer version)

(Check /usr/local/bin/view-javadoc to see if all javadoc directories are correct)
